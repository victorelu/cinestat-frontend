            <strong>What is this?</strong><br />
            This tool gives you more insight into your movie watching habits and provides fun information about the movies you watched, based on your IMDb rating history.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Who is this for?</strong><br />
            It can be used by anyone with a IMDb user account that has made it a habit to rate movies after watching them.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>How does it work?</strong><br />
            <ol>
              <li>First and foremost, you need either an <a target="_blank" href="https://imdb.com">IMDb</a> user account or a CSV file in an identical format like the one IMDb provides. It would be weird to already have something like this, but who am I to judge.</li>
              <li>Log in to IMDb, click on your name in the top right, click on Your Ratings.</li>
              <li>Click on the three vertical dots - it's a menu! - and then click on Export - this will download a CSV file to your computer.</li>
              <li>Come back to this page and upload the file.</li>
            </ol>
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>What about the privacy of my data?</strong><br />
            No information is sent to a server - all the data parsing happens in the browser. No need to be afraid of being shamed by your friends for the movies you watched.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>But what if I do want my friends to see my ratings?</strong><br />
            The feature is planned, and if time allows, it will actually be built.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Who built this thing?</strong><br />
            It's built by <a href="https://victor.avasiloaei.com" target="_blank">Victor Avasiloaei</a>, a software developer based in Amsterdam, Netherlands, who finds it weird to refer to himself in 3rd person.<br />
            The code behind it is available on <a href="" target="_blank">GitHub</a>. This page is NOT affiliated with IMDb in any way.
